### Description

This little gem will paint a any picture right before your eyes! It does this through an adjustable filter for pixel selection and five paint options. This is more than just manipulating colors. This program will paint any picture

in a very eye pleasing way! I can not really describe it and a screen shot won't help much as their is real time painting involved. But I can gaurantee you won't be disappointed. For those of you familiar with my "Angel Viewer" presentation program, I took the Draw routine and enhanced it extensively here. Using this program will prove very simple. Simply open a picture, select a filter and speed value, and press a paint option button. You may also select a background color from the menu. On the filter you should use 1 for clipart type pictures with solid colors. On photo type images larger numbers should be used with 100 producing very good results. The filter and speed values can even be adjusted while the painting is being done!

I have included a few images for you to try.

The code is heavily commented for those who might like to utilize this ap. There is no api.

Each paint option has its own dedicated module with the main structural difference being a tiny function. This is so that any modifications or enhancements one might want to make to the painting effect, would be only to the function instead of the large procedure. Of course, one would have to understand the procedure first.:o)

I think you will really enjoy this one!
